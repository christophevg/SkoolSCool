Examples

This directory contains some examples of typical pages you will want to
implement on top op SkoolSCool. Because by itself SkoolSCool is like an empty
box (of chocolates), you need to construct your own site and administration on
top of it.

The examples are kept as simple as possible, to allow even less-experienced
users to setup the site and customize the pages to their liking.

The minimum set of pages you probably want/need to create is:

- user administration: admin.users.html
	This page gives you an overview of users and allows you to manage them.
