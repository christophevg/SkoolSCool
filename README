SkoolSCool
A small and very specific SCMS for an elementary school's website

---

SkoolSCool is a very simple SCMS (Social Content Management System) for
schools, their teachers and parents. It allows basic content creation, offers
a simple user management and includes some basic social elements that allow
for interaction and collaboration. It also aims to be totally independent,
which makes it easy to implement, use and adapt.

Minimal survival steps:

$ git clone https://github.com/christophevg/SkoolSCool.git
$ cd SkooSCool/
$ make init

DISCLAIMER

This project is currently mainly used to create and rollout a new website for
my kids' school. The only skin that is provided is that of their school. The
project is useable for others, but you'll need some PHP knowledge and be ready
to proceed in undocumented areas.

As soon as the site of my kids' school is close to finalized, I'll be adding a
blank skin and documentation, thus making the project a lot more accessible.
